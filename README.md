Unbalanced data and sorting issues

In this project I applied the techniques of over-sampling and under-sampling. 
These are methods that equalize the amount of unbalanced classifications. 
In other words, it will either decrease the set of observations with the majority classification, 
or it will increase the observations with the minority classification.
